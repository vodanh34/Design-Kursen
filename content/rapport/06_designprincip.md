Evaluation of Design Elements and Principles of Websites
=========================
The purpose of this research is to evaluate as well as to find out if there are any influential for the design of elements and principles that the digital game distributions websites uses and deploy.

Selection
----------------
For this research I have decided to continue with the sites from my previous researches. Which are websites that distribute digital games online.

* **Good Old Games (GOG)**
* **Epic Games Store**
* **Steam**

As mention in my previous researches, I have always love gaming and using those digital distribution websites to get hold of games has always been the way to since the early age of digital games distribution. Thus, it would be interesting to evaluate as well as to find out if there are any influential for the design elements and principles that those websites uses and deploy.

Method
---------
There are no tools being used to evaluate the design elements and principles of the websites however the method that’s being used are based on a lot of references from different sites that’s being provided for this course moment and references that being used the most are “Design Elements & Principles”.

* **[Dbwebb design course](dbwebb.se/kurser/design-v2/kmom06/)**
* **[Design elements and principles](canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/)**

In order to evaluate the design elements and principles of the websites, the first things being done is to check each websites and see if there are any design elements and principles that’s being used based on the references being used listed above to the best of my understanding after which will be noted down.

Result
------------
**Good Old Games (GOG)**

The purpose and goal of this website is to distribute digital games across the web and thus eliminating the need for physical stores.

The design being deploy here are first and foremost colour followed by shape. The colour here are referring to colour theory by using colour harmony which gives of a pleasant to the eyes feeling. As for shape, the shape being deploy is geometric shapes which is in the form of square and rectangle. What characterise is the simple in design and its shape.

The design gives of a pleasant to the eyes as well as a familiar felling due to the use of shapes. Games usually have interface of rectangle or square as well as simplicity, thus the design of the website align with the UI of the game and thus favours the site goal and purpose greatly as it gives a familiar feeling and probably allow for more purchases and easy to use.

The characterise of design principles of the website is framing and balance. The framing is being used on the highlights section and balance is being used on the rest of the websites. Such as the use of shapes divided in four centred as well as one big element followed with four small elements next to it.

Comparing subpages with the main page, the site generally follows the same design principles. Mostly using balance principles. However, looking at the about page of the site there are also a few more principles being used. Such as Perspective, Movements and Unity.

**Epic Games Store**

[FIGURE src="image/epic_news.png"]

Just like GOG the purpose and goal here is to distribute games digitally across the web.

The design being used here is shape, the shape being used here is rectangle and just like GOG, what characterise it is the simplicity in design and the use of shape.

The feeling the design gives of is a modern and clean and a familiar feeling to that of games UI. Therefore, it benefits the site goal and purpose; To distribute games digitally.

The characterise of the design principles on the site is the use of balance and framing just like GOG. Example of it is the use of shape to create a balance of four or five in the form of rectangle. Hence the site uses mostly balance and framing principle.

Comparing subpages and main page the site generally follows the balance principle. Which gives a unity feeling to the site.

**Steam**

[FIGURE src="image/steam_about.png"]
[FIGURE src="image/steam_community.png"]

The purpose and goal of this website is to distribute games digitally across the web, just like the previous two sites.

Grid and shape are the design elements of this website. Thus, the characterise of the website is the use of shape and its familiar feeling to that of a game interface.

By using shape as design element, it resembles that of the games interface, since the site purpose and goal is to distribute game digitally, thus, this kind of approach helps the sites purpose and goal.

The characterise of the design principle of the website is a combination of unity and balance. Example is that some part uses balance while some part uses ”scale” where sometime the right site has greater proportion than the left and vice versa.

The sites subpages consist just like the main page mostly of scale with shape and some subpage even deploy Movement and Perspective principle.

Analyse
-----------------
Based on the research above. All the site deploys the design principle of balance and design elements is that of geometry shape and the shape they have in common is the rectangle. 

Apart from that they also deploy some other design principle such as movement and perspective on their subpages.

The conclusion I come to from the research is that all these sites follow the simple and modern design as well as giving of the familiar feeling of that of a game’s interface to create familiarity as well as a balance to the site.
