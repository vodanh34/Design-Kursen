Design and Website
=========================
The purpose of this research is to examine the Design Element and Principle of MMORPG news websites.

Selection
----------------
For this research I’m going to examine MMORPG news websites. Those websites usually list MMORPG and cover news about MMORPG. For this research I have decided to examine the following websites:

* **mmorpg.com**
* **mmohuts.com**
* **mmos.com**

The reason for these selections is because I’m a MMORPG player and has played MMORPG since I was little so it would be interesting to see the Design Element and Principle those websites choose to implement or whether or not they think about design at all? 

Method
---------
There are few tools being used for this research, the tools being used are to check the colour theme as to evaluate the design elements and principles of the websites however, the method that’s being used are based on a lot of references from different sites.

* **Firefox Eyedropper**
* **Paletton.com**
* **Dbwebb.se/kurser/design-v2/kmom06/**
* **En.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_design_elements_and_principles**

In order to analyse the colour, the Eyedropper are used to select the colour that I consider to be the base colour. Follow with the other colour present on the site, afterwards paletton.com is being used to determine the colour theme. As for the Design Element and Principle the first things being done is to check each website and see if there are any design elements and principles that’s being used based on the references being listed above to the best of my knowledge after which will be noted down.

Result
------------
**MMORPG**

[FIGURE src="image/MMORPG.png"]

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #212226">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #2e2f34">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #1a8dff">
</tr>
</table>

The website deploy Monochromatic colour scheme of dark-grey and a bit of tint to make some part lighter grey. With accent colour being blue, there are some other accent colours as well such as purple, red, green and orangeish/yellowish, however, they are being used very sparingly.

MMORPG uses geometric shape as a design element in the form of rectangle.

As for typography the site uses sans-serif with the eception of their logo which is in serif.

The site deploy the principle of Unity and a bit of Movement in the form of auto scrolling. As for Unity, the site deploy the same header and same colour theme across their pages. 

The site also seems to deploy the flat design. As a result the site looks modern, clean, neat and easy to navigate.

**MMOHuts**

[FIGURE src="image/MMOHuts.png"]

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #efefef">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #ffffff">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #272525">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #1b8a32">
</tr>
</table>

MMOHuts too uses Monochromatic Colour Scheme with accent colour being green, this is probably to keep it unity with their logo, which is also being half green half dark-grey. 

This site seems to be using grid-based design. As for the elements on the website, geometric shape in the form of rectangle.

As for font, the site uses sans-serif typography with the exception is their logo which is in serif.

The site uses Unity since the header and the colour scheme as well as the layout are the same across their sub-pages.

Together with flat design and a sans-serif gives of a somewhat clean design but because of the use of grid-based design it feels somewhat more out of date since these kinds of design are more seen in the earlier days.

**MMOs**

[FIGURE src="image/MMOs.png"]

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #e5e5e5">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #f3f2f2">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #eeeeee">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #333333">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #0a0a0a">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #e84747">
</tr>
</table>

This site too uses monochromatic colour scheme however with a tint and shade of grey to make the colour darker and light on the header and footer as well as using accent colour of red.

Just like MMOHuts, this site also seems to be using the grid-based design. With geometric shape in the form of rectangle.

As for typography, the site uses sans-serif typography which gives the site a clean and neat feeling to it.

This too uses Unity since the colour scheme is the same across the pages, the same is also true with their elements and menu. 

MMOs also uses flat design which gives the website a clean and neat felling together with sans-serif typography giving off a game feeling which serves the site well.

Analyse
-----------------
Based on the result above all the sites seems to be using a monochromatic colour scheme with accent colour that usually go well with their logo. Most of the site for the research uses the grid-based design. And all of them uses flat design with geometric shape and using Unity as Design Principle.

By using sans-serif together with flat design the websites give off a clean and neat vibe but also a familiar feeling to that of a game. Which serves them well in this regard since they are targeting gamers.

Personal Verdict and Preferences
--------------------------------------
As for personal verdict and preferences. I’m preferring mmorpg.com more since that site gives off a modern feeling and that design are considered carefully while the other two site there seems design are considered but not so careful and feel really out of date and that they should have update their site a while back.
