Web Design and Current Meta
=========================
The purpose of this research is to find out about the design and the current trend of the researched sites.

For this research I’m going to look into the Design Element and Principle, to see which site deploys what as well as to check for the current meta.

Selection
----------------
For this research I have decided to look into insurance company’s websites. The following are the websites I’m going to investigate.

* **Lansforsakringar**
* **If…**
* **Trygg Hansa**

The reason for these selections is because it would be interesting to see what they have in common when it comes to design and how well it serves their purposes. 

Method
---------
There are few tools being used for this research, the tools being used are to check the colour theme as to evaluate the design elements and principles of the websites however, the method that’s being used are based on a lot of references from different sites.

* **Firefox Eyedropper**
* **Paletton.com**
* **Dbwebb.se/kurser/design-v2/kmom06/**
* **En.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_design_elements_and_principles**

In order to analyse the colour, the Eyedropper are used to select the colour that I consider to be the base colour. Follow with the other colour present on the site, afterwards paletton.com is being used to determine the colour theme. As for the Design Element and Principle the first things being done is to check each website and see if there are any design elements and principles that’s being used based on the references being listed above to the best of my knowledge after which will be noted down.

Result
------------
**Landsforsakringar**

[FIGURE src="image/Lansforsakringar.png"]

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #e5eff7">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #ffffff">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #005aa0">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #e30613">
</tr>
</table>

The website uses Monochromatic Colour Scheme of light-blue as base colour then going to white and dark-blue. By using the paletton website it seems like the colour is modified a bit since the result from paletton “dark-blue” is not quite the same dark-blue as Lansforsakringar. And lastly the site uses red as accent colour to denote important elements.

The site also uses the design element of geometric shape, where the shape are in the form of rectangle.

Lansforsakringar also uses both serif and sans-serif typography. Where sans-serif seems to be the main typography and are being used on bread-text as well as the menu and headers while serif are being used as special headers.

The Design Principle being used on the website are Unity and a bit of Movement in form of the shape enlarge when hover over. As for Unity, the site deploy the same header and same colour theme across their pages.

Flat Design seems to be the main theme of the site. As a result the site looks modern, clean, neat and easy to navigate with important elements are 1 click away.

**IF...**

[FIGURE src="image/ifforsakring.png"]

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #ede6e1">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #faf9f7">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #635854">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #0054f0">
</tr>
</table>

IF... also deploy Monochromatic Colour Scheme with base colour being light brown/pinkish then ranging from slightly white to brownish with blue as accent colour. 

Geometric shape is also being used on IF... as an Design Element, the shape are in the form of rectangle.

As for font, the site uses sans-serif typography with the exception is their logo which is in serif.

IF... too uses Unity since the colour scheme is the same across the pages, the same is also true with their elements and menu. 

Together with flat design and a sans-serif gives of a modern, neat, clean website.

**Trygg Hansa**

[FIGURE src="image/trygghansa.png"]

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #f2f2f2">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #2f2f2f">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #393939">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #f00000">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #1485a3">
</tr>
</table>

Trygg Hansa too uses the Monochromatic Colour Scheme, however with a tint and shade to make the colour darker and light on the header and footer. With accent colours of red and blue, where blue only being used sparingly while red being used quite a lot.

This site too deploys the geometric shape in the form of rectangle.

As for font, the site uses sans-serif typography which gives the site a clean and neat modern feeling to it.

This too uses Unity since the colour scheme is the same across the pages, the same is also true with their elements and menu. 

As well as the site going with flat design which gives the website a modern, clean and neat felling.

Analyse
-----------------
Based on the research, the **META** for those insurance company is the use of flat design, Unity as Design Principle and Monochromatic Colour Scheme where white seems to be one of the main colour with accent colour of blue and red and geometric shape in the shape of rectangle as elements.

All the website has the thing in common is that important elements are one click away with a modern, clean and neat look as well as easy to navigate.

Personal Verdict and Preferences
--------------------------------------
As for personal verdict and preferences. I’m noting here that all the site uses some form of accent colour. Mostly in the form of blue. But if looking at the colour scheme closely the colours aren’t being used at random but are carefully selected.

* Blue convey the meaning of trust.
* Red convey the meaning of passion.
* Brown convey the meaning of growth.

For lansforsakringar, they want to give of a feeling of trust and stability with red accent to detonate passion, like the “hjälp” in red to detonate they want to help you with passion.

As for IF… they used brown to convey to grown together, though I do not think of how well this growth is doing for an insurance company.

As for Trygg Hansa they want to give of a feeling of passion and love that’s why they use a lot of red as accent colour, in a way this is probably to convey they are here to help, and just not help but to help with love and passion.

For my preference, I prefer the design of Lansforsakringar better than the other two mainly, IF... feels a bit dull while Trygg Hansa feels a bit chaotic, this is probably the use of red colour. Because for me that red colour is being used too much.
