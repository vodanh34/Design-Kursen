The Characteristic Colour Theme of Game Store Website.
=========================
The purpose of this research is to find the common characteristic of colour theme of website specialise in selling digital games online.

Selection
------------
For this research I have decided to choose the three major website that distribute digital games online:

* **Good Old Games (GOG)**
* **Epic Games Store**
* **Steam**

The reason for the selection above is due to my interest in gaming and have been using website that distribute games digitally for many years and would be interesting to analyse their colour theme to find common links between them.

Method
----------
The tools being used to analyse the colour theme are:

* **Firefox**
* **Eyedropper**
* **Palettoon.com**

In order to analyse the colour theme, the Eyedropper are used to select the background colour since it seems to be the main colour. Follow with the other colour present on the site, afterwards paletton.com is being used to determine the colour theme being used on the website.

Result
----------
**Good Old Games (GOG)**

The colour theme being used here is a Split-complementary with a slight of customised colour if looking at the red and purple. As for the footer and the header a Monochromatic theme is being used together with tint and shade to create a darker and lighter grey effect to keep it consistent all over the website.

The accent colour here are purple and red, they are used to denote important aspect of the page, such as the discount, link and sign-in button.

The H-tags and body text are all in sans-serif which gives of a clean and modern feeling to the site.

Note that the website changes its colour theme based on season and holiday to indicate and to give off a feeling of the season. As the day of this research the theme for this webpage is green which I do not know as to why they chose so since we are in the beginning of the winter season. As for the typography it serves the website well in which it gives of a clean and modern feeling but also the feeling that's close to the games, this is probably due to games also use san-serif typography. Which bring us back to the point that it serves the website well.

**Epic Game Store**

[FIGURE src="image/Epic.png"]

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #021411">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #0078f2">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #2a2a2a">
</tr>
</table>

Monochromatic is the colour theme being used on this website with header and footer being in grey for the whole page to give it a unity feeling. 

The accent colour here is blue to denote important elements of the website.

Sans-serif are being used in both H-tags and body text and thus giving off a feeling of modern and clean.

Just like GOG, this website also uses green as its main colour, though a much darker green. But unlike GOG this website uses a Monochromatic colour theme with blue as complementary colour to denote important aspect of the website such as the discount and grey for footer and header to keep the unity of the site. The feeling I get from this website is a bit dark but altogether still gives off a clean and modern feeling together with the sans-serif typography and serves well as a digital game distribution platform. 

**Steam**

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #1c263a">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #a1cd44">
</tr>

Steam uses a colour theme of Monochromatic with a tint and shade to make it darker and lighter on header and footer. 

Green is being used as an accent colour to denote important element of the website, such as discount, buying and install.

Just like the other two previous websites, the typography used here is also in sans-serif and gives of a modern and clean feeling. Also notice here that just like GOG, Steam also changes its theme based on seasons and holidays. Upon visiting the website, the feelings ones get is that itâ€™s the winter season due to the colour transition from light blue/cyan to darker with a bit of snow effect.

Analyse
-------------
Based on the research above, all the website shares a common point in that the typography is in sans-serif to gives off a modern and clean feeling. This is probably due to typography in games are also of sans-serif which gives the consumer a feeling of familiar and transition well with the website.

About 66% of the site researched uses a Monochromatic colour scheme with a complement colour to denote important element. 

As for complement colour to denote important element, all the above website has traces of them.

Two out of the three sites have theme based on season and holiday, thus their colour theme changed based on that.

As the final conclusion, it seems that most of the site deploy colour theme based on season and holidays to give off the feeling of belonging and make it easier for their consumer to know which season we are in. They all share the common trait to have a modern and clean feeling when it comes to typography as well as a majority use a Monochromatic colour theme with complement colour in all the site researched to denote important elements.
